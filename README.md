## Inspiration

Although infants get free healthcare in the US, parents in disadvantaged communitites often lack the knowlegde of essential healthcare and  development that must be practiced at home. The emotional, social and physical development of young children has a direct effect on their overall development and on the adult they will become. We thought it would be helpful for parents to have access to the relevant information based on the stage in the child's development and user inputed data as well as track developmental milestones to closely monitor and foster the child's development.

## What it does
The app creates a record of the child's development and provides essential information to the user(parent/guardian) based on stage of development and user generated data.
The app allows a parent/guardian to create a profile of their child and easily record their development by tracking developmental milestones. The user responds to prompts based on the child's stage of development. For example, if a child is approaching 2 months old the app will send a prompt asking if the user has taken it for the hepatits B vaccine and if they notice the child trying to lift up his/her head when it lays on it's back. The app provides information about that milestone and also the next developmental milestone to look out for. This provides to user with information and also serves as a reminder for the user.
The users are incentivised to use the app through peer accountability and ease of data input.
By knowing what to look out for and having an idea of what to expect the app encourages proactive action and early diagnosis of problems.
The data of the child's development is visualised in a timeline and can be used by both parents and physicians in their diagnosis.




## How I built it
The web application was build using AngularJS, AngularMaterial, Firebase,HTML, CSS, Javascript, D3.js.

## Challenges I ran into
initially we wanted to use demographic health data as well as the child development data and user inputed data to generate prompts using a machine learning algorithmUnavailability of data sources made it difficult to provide useful insights for the parents. Also, Angular Material design had a steep learning curve. 

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
Developed an app aimed at assisting parents in poor communities and keep track of child's health. 

## What I learned

## What's next for First_steps
Deploying it to Play store.
